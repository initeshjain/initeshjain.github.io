              I'm a software engineer with over four years of experience building scalable systems, automating infrastructure, and delivering engineering solutions that create real business impact. At Tata Consultancy Services, I contributed to Kroger's digital platform by enhancing a microservices-based item curation systemâ€”leading feature upgrades and managing complex service migrations.

              I also built Hawk Eye, a monitoring hub developed with Go and React that unified observability across 17+ applications, significantly improving operational visibility and efficiency.

              Earlier, as a DevOps Tech Lead, I designed CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and JFrog Artifactory, which boosted our release speed by 30%. I also created modular monitoring tools and an image tracking system that helped reduce operational costs by $15,000. Leading a team of 14 engineers, I improved delivery velocity by 20% and cut critical issue turnaround time by 15%.

              Proficient in Golang, Java, Python, JavaScript, and a wide range of cloud-native tools, I bridge backend, frontend, and DevOps disciplines into a unified engineering approach. I build systems that scale, tools that save time and money, and processes that evolve with the business.
